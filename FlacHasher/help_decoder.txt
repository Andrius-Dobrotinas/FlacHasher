  AUDIO DECODER SET UP

- The program needs to know the path to the Audio Decoder executable file. It can be a full path or just a file name, in which case it gets looked up in paths configured in PATH environment variable.
If not specified, the value is assumed to be "flac.exe", in which case it uses default decoder parameters (unless explicitly defined).

- Multiple Audio decoder configurations can be stored as decoder Profiles. For that, a decoder section must be named [Decoder.YourName] -- eg, [Decoder.FLAC]. A default decoder can be stored simply as [Decoder].
A go-to profile can then be specified in "Profile.Decoder".

Each profile must have the following values configured:

{DECODER_PARAMS}
