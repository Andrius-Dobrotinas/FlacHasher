A "hashfile" can either contain just the hashes (with no file names) or filenames with hashes.
If a hashfile contains file names, then HashfileEntrySeparator must be configured.
Any character sequence can be used as a separator between filename-hash, except for quote chars. However, if filename or hash value contain said separator char sequence, then these values must be presented in quotes. For example:
  "file 1.flac" 34579878657567543 -- separator is Space char (" ") and filename contains a space, therefore filename must be in quotes
  "file-1.flac"-34579878657567543 -- separator is a dash and filename contains a dash, therefore filename must be in quotes
