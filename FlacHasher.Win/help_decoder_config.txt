Multiple Audio decoder configurations can be stored as profiles. For that, a decoder section must be named [Decoder.YourName] -- eg, [Decoder.FLAC]. Default decoder can be stored as simply [Decoder].
A go-to profile can be specified in "Profile.Decoder".

Each profile must have the following values configured:

{DECODER_PROFILE_CONFIG}

The following configuration is global (not profile-specific):

{DECODER_CONFIG}
