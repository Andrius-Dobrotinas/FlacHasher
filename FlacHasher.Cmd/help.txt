This program hashes actual (uncompressed) audio content of a file without any of the metadata. It produces the same result for the same audio data regardless of metadata tags, compression level and even format/codec (provided it's lossless). This allows fingerprinting of actual audio data without having to "freeze" metadata tags after and comparison of two files on pure audio data level.
It also does verification: a comparison of hashes of specified files against what's recorded in a text file (here referred to as "hashfile").

===========================================================
  IMPORTANT!
It uses external 3rd party audio decoders that have to be obtained and installed by the user. It can be configured to decode any type of file as long as the decoder has an executable command-line interface and can accept input either via std-input or command-line parameters.
By default, it tries to use FLAC decoder. To use any other decoder, it has to be configured manually -- see parameter/configuration reference.

===========================================================
The following commands are available:
  - hash (operation name is optional, it executes by default)
  - verify
  - help (for parameter/configuration reference)

===========================================================
  HASHING

- One or more files can be hashed at a time. The hashes are written to std-out stream (whereas the rest of the info - to std-error), which means that they can be written to a file using standard output redirection commands.

- To hash an audio file(s):
  flachasher [--param=value]

for example:
  flachasher --input=c:\muzak\slts.flac --algorithm=md5
    or
  flachasher --input=c:\muzak\slts.flac --algorithm=md5 --decoder=flac
    or
  flachasher --input=c:\muzak\slts.flac --algorithm=md5 --decoder="c:\program files\flac\flac"

The most important parts here are:
  1) input audio files
  2) audio decoder
  3) hashing algorithm
  4) output format

===========================================================
  VERIFICATION

A "hashfile" can either contain just the hashes (with no file names) or filenames with hashes.
Input to "verify" command consists of:
  1) hashfile
  2) actual audio files
  3) audio decoder
  4) hashing algorithm
  5) hashfile format

===========================================================
IMPORTANT: If a command-line parameter value has any spaces, put the whole value in quotes.
Many aspects can be configured via the settings file, in which case they don't have to be specified via the command-line parameters.
